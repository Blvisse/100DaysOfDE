This repo documents my journey through Learning Data Engineering Concepts for 100 days 

# Day 1
## Scala Fundamentals

Tried out a new programming language, Scala (Scalable Programming Language). It is a lot like Java and uses the Same JVM compiler. It does have some cool syntax and structure compared to Java. 

On this day we reviewed just but the tip of the ice-berg that is scala. The code can be found in the branch dubbed day_1. Or on the main branch under the scala folder.
